Join us for our exhibition to experience various mediums of digital art, like editorial and graphic design, animation, photography, UI/UX design, mixed media, illustrations, fashion design, VR and video editing. SPECTRA is a chance for everyone to enjoy the unique perspectives and innovative approaches each student brings to their work, where the endless possibilities of digital art take shape.')
